# About the repo

This repo is created to save 'chunk of code' that I needed to make as
needed to built my own personal portfolio. There can be a lot of 
libraries or framework to do the perticular task, and that's the main 
point of this repo. Mostly all of the functionalities are written 
with the help ground level basic language.
